# Executive Summary

## AI Security and Governance Framework: A Strategic Imperative

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have become integral to organizational operations across industries. However, the increasing sophistication and deployment of these systems introduce complex security challenges that traditional cybersecurity frameworks fail to adequately address. This comprehensive AI Security and Governance Framework addresses these challenges by providing a structured approach to securing AI systems throughout their lifecycle.

### Key Challenges Addressed

This framework addresses several critical challenges in AI security governance:

1. **Threat Landscape Complexity**: AI systems face unique threats beyond traditional cybersecurity concerns, including data poisoning, model inversion attacks, and adversarial examples.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Organizations must navigate an evolving regulatory landscape with varying requirements across jurisdictions for AI system development and deployment.

3. **Supply Chain Integrity**: The complex nature of AI development, involving multiple components, datasets, and pre-trained models, creates significant supply chain vulnerabilities.

4. **Multi-Entity Collaboration**: Organizations increasingly need to share AI assets across organizational boundaries while maintaining security and intellectual property protection.

5. **Vendor Management**: Dependencies on third-party AI services and models introduce risks related to data usage limitations and model retraining restrictions.

### Framework Components

This document provides a comprehensive approach to AI security governance through five interconnected components:

1. **MITRE/OWASP Mapping**: A unified view of AI security threats by mapping the MITRE ATT&CK framework for AI to the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models, providing a comprehensive threat modeling foundation.

2. **Model Lifecycle Security**: A detailed security approach covering pre-training, training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring phases, ensuring security controls at each stage of AI development.

3. **SBOM/SPDX and Model Traceability**: Implementation guidance for Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and SPDX specifications adapted for AI models, enabling transparency and traceability of model components.

4. **Vendor Limitations Management**: Strategies for navigating contractual and technical limitations imposed by AI vendors regarding data usage and model retraining.

5. **Multi-Entity Isolation**: Architectural patterns and security controls for maintaining isolation between entities when sharing AI infrastructure, models, or data.

### Implementation Benefits

Organizations implementing this framework can expect:

- **Reduced Security Incidents**: Comprehensive threat modeling and security controls minimize the risk of AI-specific attacks.
- **Regulatory Readiness**: Alignment with emerging AI regulations and standards ensures compliance and reduces legal exposure.
- **Enhanced Transparency**: Model traceability and documentation improve stakeholder trust and facilitate audits.
- **Operational Resilience**: Structured approach to vendor management and multi-entity collaboration reduces operational disruptions.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Robust AI governance enables faster, more confident deployment of AI innovations.

### Recommended Approach

We recommend a phased implementation approach:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current AI systems against the framework components to identify gaps.
2. **Prioritization**: Address high-risk areas first, particularly those related to data security and model integrity.
3. **Implementation**: Deploy security controls and governance processes across the AI lifecycle.
4. **Monitoring**: Establish continuous monitoring and improvement processes.
5. **Maturity Development**: Progressively enhance capabilities across all framework components.

This framework provides organizations with the tools needed to develop, deploy, and maintain AI systems securely while navigating the complex landscape of AI security threats, regulatory requirements, and multi-entity collaborations.

# SBOM/SPDX and Model Origin Traceability for AI Systems

## Introduction

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) standards have evolved to address the unique challenges of AI systems through AI Bill of Materials (AI BOMs). This document explores how these standards support model origin traceability, transparency, and security in AI development and deployment.

## What is an AI Bill of Materials (AI BOM)?

An AI BOM is a comprehensive inventory of all components associated with an AI system. Similar to traditional SBOMs used in software development, an AI BOM provides a detailed list of all elements that contribute to an AI model's functionality, including:

- Software libraries and frameworks
- Training datasets and their sources
- Model architectures and algorithms
- Hyperparameters and configurations
- Base models (for transfer learning)
- Dependencies and their versions
- Licenses and usage restrictions

AI BOMs extend beyond traditional SBOMs by including AI-specific elements such as training data provenance, model architecture details, and ethical considerations.

## SPDX 3.0 AI Profile

The SPDX 3.0 specification has introduced an AI Profile that standardizes how AI system information is documented and communicated. This profile includes several key properties specifically designed for AI systems:

### Key Properties in SPDX 3.0 AI Profile

14. **AI/sensitivePersonalInformation**: Identifies sensitive data handling
15. **AI/standardCompliance**: Lists standards and regulations followed
16. **AI/typeOfModel**: Specifies the model type (neural network, decision tree, etc.)

## Model Cards as Complementary Documentation

Model Cards work alongside AI BOMs to provide standardized documentation for machine learning models. While AI BOMs focus on component inventories and dependencies, Model Cards provide:

- Performance characteristics across different populations
- Intended uses and limitations
- Ethical considerations
- Evaluation data and results
- Training methodologies

Together, AI BOMs and Model Cards create a comprehensive documentation framework for AI systems.

## Benefits of AI BOMs for Model Traceability

### 1. Transparency and Trust
AI BOMs provide clear documentation of all components, fostering trust among users, developers, regulators, and other stakeholders. This transparency is essential for responsible AI development and deployment.

### 2. Supply Chain Security
By documenting all components and their sources, AI BOMs help identify potential vulnerabilities in the AI supply chain. This is particularly important as AI systems often incorporate open-source libraries, pre-trained models, and third-party datasets.

### 3. Vulnerability Management
AI BOMs enable quick identification of components affected by newly discovered vulnerabilities. For example, if a vulnerability is found in a specific version of a machine learning library, organizations can quickly identify which AI models use that library.

### 4. Compliance and Licensing
AI systems often use open-source components with specific licensing requirements. AI BOMs help track these licenses, ensuring compliance and avoiding legal issues related to intellectual property.

### 5. System Transparency and Auditability
The detailed inventory provided by AI BOMs enables auditors and stakeholders to understand the AI system's composition. This transparency is crucial for regulatory compliance and ethical reviews.

### 6. System Integration and Interoperability
When integrating AI systems with other software or platforms, AI BOMs help identify compatibility issues, overlapping dependencies, or version conflicts, facilitating smoother integration.

## Key Stakeholders and Their Use of AI BOMs

1. **Developers and Data Scientists**: Use AI BOMs to understand component lists and manage dependencies
2. **System Administrators**: Use AI BOMs to identify and address security or ethical vulnerabilities
3. **Security Officers**: Focus on security aspects of AI components, including those from suppliers
4. **Ethicists**: Identify and mitigate potential ethical risks in AI systems
5. **Compliance Officers**: Ensure adherence to regulations, standards, and licensing requirements
6. **Procurement Officers**: Evaluate AI components from suppliers
